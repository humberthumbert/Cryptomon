# Cryptomon
Cryptomon is a blockchain platform where players can lottery their cryptomons with Ethereum wallet, breed the new cryptomons from the ones they have owned, exchange cryptomons for the one they desire, and fight against each otherâ€™s cryptomon. It is written with native-js and solidity.

To start it, one should first install the node module in crytomon/package.json
```
npm start
```
Then in cryptomon-contract, one should
```
truffle compile
```
and after the ganache has setup, run
```
truffle migrate
```

Detail of implementation is in the [Cryptomon.pdf](https://github.com/humberthumbert/Cryptomon/blob/master/Cryptomon.pdf)
